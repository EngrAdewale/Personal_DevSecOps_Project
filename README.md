# Ì∫Ä DevSecOps Overview

**DevSecOps** stands for **Development, Security, and Operations**. It integrates **security practices** within the DevOps process to ensure that applications are built, tested, and deployed securely from the beginning, not as an afterthought.

---

## Ì¥ë Key Features

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**.

```
Repo (Code) ---> CI (Build + Test) ---> CD (Deliver or Deploy)
```

- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automates building and testing your code every time changes are pushed.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):** Automatically delivers or deploys the application to production or staging environments after testing.

---

## Ì∑± Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

IaC allows you to manage and provision infrastructure using **code** rather than manual processes.

- **Terraform:** Used to define and manage infrastructure (servers, networks, etc.) in a declarative way.
- **Ansible:** Manages **configuration** of systems, such as installing software or updating packages on servers.

---

## Ì≥¶ Containerization

Containerization packages software and its dependencies into a container so it runs reliably in different computing environments.

- Example:
  ```
  Java Code ---> Maven Build (mvn) ---> .jar File ---> Docker Container
  ```

---

## ÌæõÔ∏è Orchestration

**Kubernetes** is used to **orchestrate** (automate) deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- Ensures your application runs across a cluster of machines with high availability.

---

## Ì≥ä Monitoring

Monitoring helps ensure your system is healthy and performs well.

1. **Node Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.
2. **Logging**: Use tools like **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** to collect and analyze logs from applications and infrastructure.

---

## Ì∫Ä Deployment Strategies

Different ways to release new versions of your application safely:

- **Rolling Update**: Gradually replaces old versions with new ones without downtime.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Have two environments (blue and green); switch traffic to the new version once it's ready.
- **Rollback**: Revert to the previous version if something goes wrong.
- **Canary Deployment**: Release to a small group of users first to test, then gradually to all users.
- **Recreate**: Stop the old version completely before starting the new one.
- **A/B Testing**: Test two versions with different user groups to compare performance.
- **Shadow Deployment**: Send real traffic to the new version **without** showing it to users (used for testing).
